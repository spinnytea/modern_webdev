1. document VSCode extensions (why do they do for us)
1. document package.json (what do we do, which packages are involved)
1. write a gulp plugin (like, a styleguide lint, or a bootstrap markup lint)
1. write sample project, document which packages are for which parts

What's in the project
---------------------
